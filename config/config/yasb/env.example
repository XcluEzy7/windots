# YASB GitHub Widget Configuration
# 
# This file is an example template for configuring the YASB GitHub widget.
# 
# To use this file:
# 1. Copy this file to .env in the same directory:
#    Copy-Item env.example .env
# 
# 2. Replace YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token
#    Get your token from: https://github.com/settings/tokens
#    Required scopes: notifications (read)
#
# 3. Note: If you use the environment variable method (recommended), you don't need this file.
#    The environment variable YASB_GITHUB_TOKEN will be used instead.
#    The Setup.ps1 script can configure this automatically during Git setup.
#
# IMPORTANT: The .env file is gitignored for security. Never commit your actual token!

YASB_GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE
